[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of protofacs is to provide tools for storing and manipulating data from
the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) 2002 edition.

## Installation

You can install the development version of protofacs from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("jmgirard/protofacs")
```

## Example

```{r}
library("protofacs")
# Clean up messy codes and set class
messy_codes <- c(" 12B+ 1 +L2", "T20 + 25")
clean_codes <- coding(messy_codes)
clean_codes
```

```{r}
# Which behaviors were coded for occurrence, intensity, and asymmetry?
my_scheme <- scheme(
  list(
    occurrence = c(1, 2, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12, 14, 20, 25),
    intensity  = c(6, 12),
    asymmetry  = c(2, 6, 10, 12, 14, 20)
  )
)
my_scheme
```

```{r}
# Extract occurrence matrix
occurrence(clean_codes, my_scheme)

# Extract intensity matrix
intensity(clean_codes, my_scheme)

# Extract asymmetry matrix
asymmetry(clean_codes, my_scheme)
```
